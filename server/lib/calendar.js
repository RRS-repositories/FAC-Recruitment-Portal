/**
 * The manager's calendar.
 *
 * Read-only, and deliberately so: it shows what the portal already knows —
 * interviews that were booked, time that was blocked, hours that were
 * configured. Nothing here decides anything. A slot it draws as free is free
 * because the availability engine says so, and booking one still goes through
 * that engine, the advisory lock and the exclusion constraint exactly as a
 * candidate's booking does.
 *
 * The grid is built HERE rather than in the browser. Working out which
 * instants make up 09:00–17:00 in Europe/London, across a clock change, is the
 * kind of arithmetic that should exist once — and it already exists here, in
 * the same file the candidate's slot list comes from. A second implementation
 * in the client would be a second chance to get the last Sunday in October
 * wrong.
